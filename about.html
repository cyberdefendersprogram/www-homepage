    <p>
        Cyberdefenders is looking for interns; please contact cyberdefendersprogram [at] gmail.com  to share your skills and work experiences. Let us know how you can contribute. Give us an idea of what type of projects you’d like to engage in and how we can help you build your work experience. Our part-time (10-12 hours) intern positions are unpaid; however, we’ll make up for that by helping with your concrete resume skills. Also, we are raising funds to hire one full-time intern position.
