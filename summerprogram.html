        <p><b>Will you provide computers?</b><br>No, we expect hackathon partiants to bring their laptop computers. Please reach out to us if you will have issue with that. Having said thanks to TechShop, we will have a few computers available as loaners, so reach out to us early to book them.</p>
        <p><b>Should I apply sooner to qualify?</b><br>Yes, we have limited seats so please apply early.</p>
        <p><b>What day/time will the program be on?</b><br>For in class sessions currently we are shooting for Tues & Thursdays. Idea is that in class is from 1-4 on Tuesday at Merritt and Thursday 3-6 at Laney (still TBD), the rest of 14 hours the groups are expected to work on your own time. We are trying to get a feel for what might work best for the group, and are also working on having classrooms available for rest of the days for the groups to work together.</p>

      <ul>
        <li id="guest-lecture-1"><b>Cyber Security Research: A Data Scientist’s Perspective</b> by <em>Celeste Matarazzo, LLNL</em> July 11, 5:15pm - 6:15pm at G-274 Laney College: Cybersecurity has become one of the nation’s top priorities. As all aspects of our lives become increasingly dependent on computing networks and the Internet, cybersecurity has grown from a localized economic problem to a major national imperative. Situational awareness of computer networks presents many challenges including but not limited to the volume of the data and the dynamic and evolving nature of the problem space. For example, at the perimeter of a corporate enterprise computer network, it is common to see terabytes of network traffic each day, containing millions of unique IP addresses and connection records that number in the hundreds of millions. Celeste will provide an overview and discuss recent trends facing computer security researchers and practitioners. She will describe recent work at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory to enable an analysis of computer networks. Characterizing network-wide activity depends critically on understanding time-varying patterns of system behaviors, such as the actions and connections between components. This approach makes use of state of the art data collection, building and accessing large-scale graph representations, new capabilities, and advances in data science and machine learning.<a class="button is-small is-danger" href="https://youtu.be/_CVgsCjpXPw">Recording</a> available.</li><br/>
        <li id="guest-lecture-2"><b>Hands-on Cyber Defense: </b> by <em>Aaron Goldstein, Tanium</em> July 18, 5pm - 6pm at G-274 Laney College: Aaron will talk about blue team defenses and the footprint left behind from an attack. He will outline how threat actors pillage and pilfer organization data for personal gain. What organization’s weaknesses and blind spots should a security auditor look for? Time permitting he will also touch on red teaming methodology and provide some tips and tricks of the trade.<a class="button is-small is-danger" href="https://youtu.be/hxap0fTgn-Q">Recording</a> available, and  <a class="button is-small is-info" href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1C5ZuDjbbzAScPElbuNfsyXH8dRdsfU_OrLfBrKTGxK8/edit?usp=sharing">Questions</a>.<a class="button is-small is-warning" href="">Slides</a> are shared as well.</li><br/>
