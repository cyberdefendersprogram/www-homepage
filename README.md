# Getting Started
* Make sure you have git access
* Read on pull request (flow)[https://github.com/susam/gitpr]
* Install [ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/#homebrew), install gem, install bundler
* Execute local webserver using ```bundle exec jekyll serve```
* **Note**: When running ```bundle install```, especially on Ubuntu 18.04, you may run into problems with commonmarker & nokogiri gems. Try explicit install of zlibg1 and ruby-dev with ```sudo apt install zlibg1-dev ruby-dev``` to fix this.

# Todos
* Initial page with a good design. Must have elements - Landing page, Programs, Advisors & Board. Status: Almost done.
