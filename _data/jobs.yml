  description: "We encourage all middle school or high school students to submit research that tests a reasonable hypothesis. JEI does not judge submissions based on the “cutting edge” nature of the research, and access to university labs and advanced techniques are not required. In fact, some of the most noteworthy manuscripts submitted to JEI use inexpensive, household materials in creative ways to test an interesting question. We focus on your ability to pose and successfully address an interesting scientific question, not the sophistication of the techniques."
