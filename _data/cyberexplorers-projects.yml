  description: Cyberpatriot is a very fun competition. It is really hard to explain what happens in a CyberPatriot competition to others. It is really fun, but it’s hard to communicate how fun it is or to give a demo of how a competition goes. We provide virtual images with vulnerabilities ranging in difficulty.

  description: One problem in cybersecurity is lack of human resources. Not enough people are knowledgeable of Cybersecurity or interested to learn and have potential jobs. Our idea is to make an introductory CTF for beginners. Unlike other difficult CTFs, this one will have links and resources in the hints. The idea of resources in the hints was inspired by the bandit game, which had slowly introduced added new concepts every level. It had all possible needed commands to find the password for each level. This was very useful for beginners who had no experience with a terminal. The CTF will have links to websites containing information relevant to the current problem. The CTF will introduce new people to cybersecurity

  description: Our project is a type of encryption. It uses the ceaser cipher as its base. The problem that we are trying to solve is to send messages without getting any transmissions or interruptions from an anonymous User. The caesar cipher uses a number and shifts a letter by that number. That is how it gets encrypted. Instead of numbers, we are using words. Each letter in the word correlates to a number. Those number will be the shift for the word or phrase. This is a simple encryption that most people can understand if they get a walkthrough of it. It is a way to give people an introduction to encrypting words and phrases.

  description: The project is Clue-hacker edition, and it informs about cyber security and hacking. In the game of Clue, there is one murderer, one weapon, and the room where it happened. Our version of Clue will include a hacker, method of attack, and the IP address of the hacker. The game raises awareness for cyber attacks; potentially, it has a positive effect on players. The goal is to make people aware of where they are putting their personal information. Our project will provide clues to a player to help solving the mystery of who, how, and where they got hacked.
