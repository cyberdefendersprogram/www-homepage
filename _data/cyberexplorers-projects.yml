  description: The board game mimics the mind of a hacker (how they hack) and lets people be more observant to prevent from being hacked in the future. The board game is a circle with different colored spaces. Each color has a different scenario and hacking techniques that players need to learn and use to solve a problem(e.g. blue = cryptography, red = steganography etc.). By doing this we hope people learn about hackers and hacking techniques and will be vary about hackers the next time they are online.

  description: The project is Clue-hacker edition, and it informs about cyber security and hacking. In the game of Clue, there is one murderer, one weapon, and the room where it happened. Our version of Clue will include a hacker, method of attack, and the IP address of the hacker. The game raises awareness for cyber attacks; potentially, it has a positive effect on players. The goal is to make people aware of where they are putting their personal information. Our project will provide clues to a player to help solving the mystery of who, how, and where they got hacked.

  description: Our project is a type of encryption. It uses the ceaser cipher as its base. The problem that we are trying to solve is to send messages without getting any transmissions or interruptions from an anonymous User. The caesar cipher uses a number and shifts a letter by that number. That is how it gets encrypted. Instead of numbers, we are using words. Each letter in the word correlates to a number. Those number will be the shift for the word or phrase. This is a simple encryption that most people can understand if they get a walkthrough of it. It is a way to give people an introduction to encrypting words and phrases.

  description: Our project is a cyber security software that senses any trojan horses that might be downloaded onto your computer. This software allows to prevent any trojans to get onto your computer. Trojans can do a lot of damage, so this software can really help you prevent losing important information. Whenever you download a file, our software scans the file for trojan horses. If the software finds a trojan horse then it will immediately stop the download.

  description: Cyberpatriot is a very fun competition. It is really hard to explain what happens in a CyberPatriot competition to others. It is really fun, but it’s hard to communicate how fun it is or to give a demo of how a competition goes. We provide virtual images with vulnerabilities ranging in difficulty.
